# Ro! Sham! Bo!

Every Thursday, Jason, Gavin, Mark, Holly, Dania, and Toni go for lunch. In order to determine who pays, a bout of Roshambo
(aka rock-paper-scissors) is played. The problem is, programmers are lazy. Jason and Gavin can't
possibly be bothered to throw their hands manually. We need you to automate this for us.

Use _objects_, _arrays_, _strings_, _functions_ etc. This assignment will likely use every bit of JavaScript we have learned so far to build something greater than the sum of it's parts.

## Boilerplate

I've provided some boilerplate to get you started.

[https://github.com/tiy-tpa-fee/roshambo](https://github.com/tiy-tpa-fee/roshambo)

- `take ~/tiy/week-2/day-3`
- `hub clone tiy-tpa-fee/roshambo`
- `cd roshambo`
- `hub fork`
- `atom .`
- `npm install`
- `npm start`
- **HACK AWAY!**

I've more or less given you a working implementation of the HTML & CSS needed, but feel free to customize it.

## Explorer Mode

- Play against the computer
  - This means the computer has an "AI" that just throws _randomly_.
- Play one _bout_ and show the winner.
  - Each throw is considered an _engagement._
  - The best two of three _engagements_ is a _bout._
  - The best two of three _bouts_ is a _match._ (Not needed for Explorer mode.)

## Adventure mode

- Track the result of multiple games (_matches_).
  - After the match winner is shown:
    - Show a leaderboard.
    - Prompt the player to play again.

## Epic Mode

- Implement a non-random AI for the computer player based on past throws based on these strategies for [advanced Roshambo AI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rudzYPHuewc)
